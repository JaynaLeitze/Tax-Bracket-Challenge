Write a program that calculates income tax based on the following rules:

- The portion of the income that is less than $10k is untaxed
  Income up to 10K, no tax
- The portion of the income that is less than $20k is taxed at 10%
  Income up to $20K, (num/100) \* 10
- The portion of the income that is less than $50k is taxed at 20%
  Income up to $50K, (num/100) \* 20
- Any portion of the income that is above $50k is taxed at 30%
  Income > $50K, (num/100)\*30
